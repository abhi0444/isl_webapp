# India Sign Language Recognition

Many people in India are speech and/or hearing impaired, and they thus use hand gestures to communicate with other people. However, apart from a handful of people, not everyone is aware of this sign language and they may require an interpreter which can be inconvenient and expensive. This project aims to narrow this communication gap by developing software which can predict the ISL alphanumeric hand gestures in real time.
